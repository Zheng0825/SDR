\section{Gamification} 
There are a number of TV white spaces in rural communities. That is, empty spaces left for the UHF TV spectrum that dont actually have anything broadcasting on them. The team in \cite{6684374} created a Raspberry Pi system that is able to scan for these blank spaces, and geotag them. Using an RF Explorer and GPS, the system is able o scan for open bandwidth and then tag the location. The authors mention wanting to put these units in the hands of as many people as possible to create a distributed measuring system. 

The authors in \cite{6826076} present a game called Spectrum Wars. This game involves two teams 
competing to send data in a crowded environment. Players can vary Frequency, Bandwidth, and Gain of 
the signal. The first player to successfully transmit the signal wins the points. The author's present
an earlier version of their work in \cite{6817817}.
