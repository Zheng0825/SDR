This project is the basic framework for building a physical layer that can
interact with gnuradio and a MAC layer. To build this project:

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure [--prefix=INSTALLDIR] [--with-gnuradio-srcdir=GNURADIO_SRCDIR]
  $ make
  $ make check


The doc directory has been included from the directory structure taken from
gnuradio. It is not currently used for anything.
