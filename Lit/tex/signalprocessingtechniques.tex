\section{Signal Processing Techniques}

In \cite{6127519} H.T. Kung presents partial compressive sensing, a signal processing technique which reduced the frequency needed to sample a signal. This conecpt
is presented again by this research group in another paper discussing using it for communicating within a mesh network.
