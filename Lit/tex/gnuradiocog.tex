\section{Using GNU Radio for Cognitive Radio Application}

GNU Radio has been used by many different research groups to test various cognitive radio
standards. The researchers in \cite{7141228} created a simple multihop test bed using
three USRP radios to relay data from one computer to another. A forth USRP acts as a primary
user and attempts to block the signal. Their work focuses on using Reinforcement learning to allow
for the hopping and does not discuss the routing protocol used in much depth.
