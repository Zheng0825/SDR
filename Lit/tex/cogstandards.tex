\section{Cognitive Radio Standards}
In \cite{7124942} the authors discuss a MIMO scheme for transmission of packets using cognitive radio. The system is then simulated and results are prsented. In \cite{5784217} the authors discuss using a
USRP device with GNURadio to test out several routing algorithms.
