\section{Cognitive Radio based Mesh Networks}

The authors in \cite{5457862} present an overview of several cognitivate radio transmission strategies and discuss the pros and cons of each method. 
In Mesh networks, the MAC protocols are essential to prevent data "Deafness" where two nodes try to
transmit at the same time on different frequencies, preventing communication. There are a few 
different standards for this discussed in \cite{6392009}.

It is reported that video on demand services make up about 27\% of internet traffic. Therefore,
for any Mesh Network to be successful, it would have to be able to handle this type of traffic. The
author's in \cite{6112757} present a method for routing video data over multiple paths of the mesh
to the user to increase effectiveness of data transmission. An improvement upon this algorithm
is presented in \cite{6778761}.
