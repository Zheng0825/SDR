\section{Cognitive Radio and Robots}

The authors in \cite{6127507} discuss using a distributed group of spectrum sensing tools with a UAV to find a target using RF localization. They use a technique called compressive spectrum sensing to
make the task less computationally intensive. They then have a group of sensors attempt to find the source of the RF signal and then work to find it using localization techniques. The group performed
MATLAB testing. They also ran some brief field tests without a UAV using GNURadio and USRP SDRs. The authors in \cite{7119159} discuss the benefits of using a cognitive network with a UAV. The discuss 
many of the benefits that the technology would bring including security.
