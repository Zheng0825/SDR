\section{Install Ubuntu}

Hopefully in the future we will have a port of this ready to go for Fedora, but for now you MUST have Ubuntu.

This was tested with 14.04 LTS, I'm not sure how compatible it will be with other versions. 

I don't want to fill this up with an install guide for Ubuntu, so check with a friend who has done this before
or search around online and come back once you have it.

\section{Install GNU Radio and The Libraries we need}

Before beginning, make sure you will have plenty of time to leave your computer alone (around 4 hours). 

Then clone the below repo and run the install script.

git clone https://github.com/jmccormack200/GnuRadio-Vagrant-Script.git
cd GnuRadio-Vagrant-Script
sudo sh bootstrap.sh


If you're wondering why the word "vagrant" is included, that's because this can also be used to build
an entirely self contained vm on your computer. All you need is vagrant and virtual box. Using Vagrant Up in
this folder instead of sh bootstrap.sh will install and configure a virtual machine with all the files you need included.
