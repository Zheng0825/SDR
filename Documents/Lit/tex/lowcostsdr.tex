\section{Low Cost SDR and Cognitive Radio Platforms}

The Communications Research Center in Ottawa, Canada has created a cognitive radio platform that they have nicknamed CORAL. This is a custom created platform that is capable of performing cognitive radio
type tasks at the 2.4GHz and 5GHz license exempt bands.\cite{5457842}. Further research done in \cite{6654982} introduces a tool called CogFrame. This platform uses traditional computers and wifi cards
to create a congitive mesh network capable of running tests. They compare the tool to a test bed made of USRP's as well as pure simulations and found it to outperform the simulation and be on par with the
USRPs. The authors in \cite{6421105} provide a wonderful overview of everything one could want to know about cognitive radio. Including some major platforms that exist such as WARP from Rice University,
BEE From Berkley, and CORAL from the communications research center in Canada. They also present their own platform based of the BeagleBoard. This article would be great for anyone just starting out to
read. A group from Germany has created a cognitive radio based wireless microphone system \cite{6100954}.
