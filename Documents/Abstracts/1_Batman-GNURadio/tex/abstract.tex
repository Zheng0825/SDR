Software Defined Radio Networks (SDRNs)  use systems of Software Defined Radios (SDRs) to establish networks with flexible physical and link layers. GNU Radio is an open source software tool set for working with SDRs and can be used as a basis for creating SDRNs. Mesh networks are designed to allow for flexible and distributed network architectures that are self forming and function without the need for centralized infrastructure. Batman-adv is a popular, open source, layer 2 mesh network protocol.

In this paper we present the Advanced Radio Communication Adhoc Mesh Network (ARCAM-NET) Platform. Our work establishes an SDRN platform by combining GNU Radio with Batman-adv to create a fully open source software defined radio mesh network. The platform can work with any USRP SDR device to quickly prototype and experiment with SDR and Cognitive Radio (CR) Protocols. Due to the flexibility of Batman-adv and GNU Radio, programs acting above Layer 2 can utilize this network without any changes. In order to further increase the cognitive abilities of the platform, we explore using the A.L.F.R.E.D. tool chain within the batman-adv ecosystem to distribute information about frequency changes across the mesh network. This creates a novel method to globally change the frequency of the network in a completely decentralized way.
