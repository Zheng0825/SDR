# Software Defined Radio Projects

The root folder has 4 subfolders for different aspects of the project.
If you are just trying to get going with the mesh, you probably want to be in the 
SDR Folder. 


## Documents

The document section contains mostly Latex documents. These are drafts of Papers, and First efforts on Thesis related documents. Where possible, a pdf version should already be compiled so you can see the current state of that document without knowing about how to use latex. To open from the command line use: 

gnome-open <nameoffile.pdf>


## Notes

Notes is a journal of all of our attempts at making this work. It is again written in latex, and there is an additional pdf version attached. I recommend opening the tex version as I often forget to keep the pdf version up to date. Scroll to the bottom to see the latest event from that date. 


## SDR

This is where all the actual flowgraphs and related materials will be located. Use this folder as a starting point for setting up the mesh network. 

## Tools

These are helpful but not necessary components for using the flowgraphs. Examples include a Python UDP Tx/Rx, and "raiseTheBatSignal.sh" which is a shell script for automating the Batman-adv initialization process. This also contains the script for configuring tmux the way I tend to use it. In its current form this is very specific to working with our system and if I have time I will attempt to make it more dynamic.
