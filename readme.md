# Software Defined Radio Projects

This repository is to hold my progress on working with SDR. 
Currently the school has access to the following. 

+ RTL-SDR
+ BladeRF
+ Ettus Research SDR

I will be trying to evalute all three for useability and 
featureset. The RTL-SDR is weaker than the other two in all 
areas except cost. It costs less than a tenth of what the 
others do. We are hoping to use these as a tool to teach 
students to use the other two. 

## RTL-SDR

This folder holds the progress on the RTL-SDR. This will be
the first focus area of the project so that we can create
a teaching platform for other students to get caught up on.

## BladeRF

This will follow the RTL-SDR. It may be empty for a few weeks.

## Notes

I will try to keep a detailed log of notes here so that I can
more easily create a teaching tool for students.
