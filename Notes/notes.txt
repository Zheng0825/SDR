Currently working on using the RTL SDR. 

What I have learned so far: 
	* This SDR is different than a FUNCUBE dongle
	* It will work from around 500 Hz to 1700 Hz
	* It can only RECIEVE 

The fact that this can only recieve is by far the largest setback.
This will ultimately not be what we can use for cognitive radio. 

However, the tutorials still seem more widely available than those
found for the BladeRF which is bi-directional. Therefore I will
continue for a bit. It may serve a purpose as part of the larger 
sensor network at some point. We could still use it to relay information
over a large distance. 

There are "Cubelites" being sent out that are basically funcube dongle
based satellites. These sound pretty cool. 

I want to start taking notes in Latex so they will be more readable than
a plain .txt file and still useable with version control. 

I need to install texlive-full and texmaker. 

Currently I am set back by needing to update ubuntu. I can't install
anything else while the updates are installing. 

So far I have made decent progress. The RTL is working with GNU SDR. I had trouble
at first when the kernel was loading a separate driver that bogs it down. 

I used this command to fix that problem:

sudo rmmod dvb_usb_rtl28xxu rtl2823

There are more permanent ways of fixing the problem but I wanted to start
with this as it is non-permanent and will default back to normal on a restart. 

The new file in the RTL-SDR will allow you to hear FM stations. But 
they are extremely faint. I'm going to continue to play with the file settings to
see if I can get a clearer transmission.

Spent last night installing Linux onto what I thought was a faster computer, 
however my memory of the machine was incorrect. It was too slow to even open 
most webpages. So I'm back to the other Linux machine. Hopefully tonight I will
have time to try to get linux on my laptop. I remember I had issues before.
