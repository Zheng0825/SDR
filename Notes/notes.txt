Currently working on using the RTL SDR. 

What I have learned so far: 
	* This SDR is different than a FUNCUBE dongle
	* It will work from around 500 Hz to 1700 Hz
	* It can only RECIEVE 

The fact that this can only recieve is by far the largest setback.
This will ultimately not be what we can use for cognitive radio. 

However, the tutorials still seem more widely available than those
found for the BladeRF which is bi-directional. Therefore I will
continue for a bit. It may serve a purpose as part of the larger 
sensor network at some point. We could still use it to relay information
over a large distance. 

There are "Cubelites" being sent out that are basically funcube dongle
based satellites. These sound pretty cool. 

I want to start taking notes in Latex so they will be more readable than
a plain .txt file and still useable with version control. 

I need to install texlive-full and texmaker. 

Currently I am set back by needing to update ubuntu. I can't install
anything else while the updates are installing.
